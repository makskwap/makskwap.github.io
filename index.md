### **Academic and Career Interests**
Ever since high school I was interested in environmental sustinability and thus my academic pursuits reflect this. On the other hand, recently at UC Berkeley I have increasingly become interested and involved in data science and research. Hence, my pursuit of the Applied Data Science certification.
