**Academic and Career Interests**
Ever since high school I was interested in environmental sustinability and thus my academic pursuits reflect this. On the other hand, recently at UC Berkeley I have increasingly become interested and involved in data science and research. Hence, my pursuit of the Applied Data Science certification. I hope to in the future work in Impact Evaluation, Data Analytics, or Monitoring and Evaluation for an international non-profit organization focused on environmental sustinability.

**Personal Interests and Hobbies**
I am a physically active person. I love sports and physical activities such as: hiking, climbing, surfing, football (soccer). I am also love travelling/volunteering around the world, thus far I completed many projects including; Conservation in Costa Rica, Conservation in Madagascar, Conservation in Ecuador, Construction in Nepal, Community Development in Mongolia, and Community Development in South Africa.
