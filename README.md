**Academic and Career Interests**
Ever since high school I was interested in environmental sustinability and thus my academic pursuits reflect this. On the other hand, recently at UC Berkeley I have increasingly become interested and involved in data science and research. Hence, my pursuit of the Applied Data Science certification. I hope to in the future work in Impact Evaluation, Data Analytics, or Monitoring and Evaluation for an international non-profit organization focused on environmental sustinability.
